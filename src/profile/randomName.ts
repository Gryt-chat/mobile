 * A name for a phone that has not been given one.

 * something to be called, and it is different per phone. GRYT-846.
 *
 * The list is deliberately dull. These names go in front of strangers on
 * somebody else's server, they are read aloud in voice chat, and whoever gets
 * one did not choose it — so nothing here should be a joke that lands badly, a
 * word that means something else somewhere, or anything a person would mind
 * being called for the ten seconds before they change it.
 *
 * Only nouns, only English, and nothing that reads as a real person's name.
 * A stranger arriving as "Marcus" looks like a claim about who they are;
 * "Bandit" looks like what it is, which is a placeholder.
